## To Do with Secret Mentor Bad Boy from East Helsinki

### Form Input frontend and styling

Task:

Create a Sign-Up Form that asks for Name and Email address. Add this Form in a page.

### Newsletter Modal popup

Task:

Create a sign-up form that asks for email address. Add this to the Newsletter modal.

Make the logic for how to open the modal.

Ask yourself this question: Did you decide to scrap the popup modal, because tracking /sign-up url would be easier for google analytics?

### Blog/Category Archive Hero

Create a singular API-call that asks for the Hero component. If you can adjust the Hero on this part than remove the CTA-buttons.

### Sticky Nav for Blog posts

Consider making a sticky-nav for a single blog post. The nav has three elements: article title, social sharing buttons, and a CTA-to subscribe to my newsletter.
